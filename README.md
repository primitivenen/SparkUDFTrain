# Embarrassingly Parallel Model Training on Spark — Pandas UDF

Spark is one of the most popular tool to perform map-reduce tasks efficiently on large scale distributed data-sets. Additionally, Spark comes with MLlib package to perform Machine Learning on distributed data. On the flip side Python has very mature libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc. to perform data analysis and machine learning.
Spark’s native ML library though powerful generally lack in features. Python’s libraries usually provide more options to tinker with model parameters, resulting in better tuned models. However, Python is bound on single compute machine and one contiguous block of memory, which makes it infeasible to be used for training on large scale distributed data-set.
